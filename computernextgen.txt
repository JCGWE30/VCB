Registry Instructions
ldi (Load Intermediate) - Load an intermediate Value into the registry file
mov (Move) - Move a value within the registry file to another index (The original value remains unchanged)

ALU Operations
add (Add) - Add 2 numbers
adi (Add Intermediate) - Add 2 numbers
sub (Sub) - Subtract 2 numbers
sbi (Sub Intermediate) - Subtract 2 numbers
mul (Multiply) - Multiply 2 numbers together
mli (Multiply Intermediate) - Multiply 2 numbers together

or (Or) - Store flags for comparison
not (Not) - Store flags for comparison
rft (Right Shift) - Right shift
lft (Left Shift) - Left shift

Memory Operations
ins (Insert to memory) - Insert a value into the memory
ext (Extract from memory) - Extract a value from the memory

Instruction Pointer Operations
jmp (Jump) - Jump to a specified address
bch (Branch) - Jump to a specified address if a condition is met

Stack Operations
psh (Push) - Push a value from the registry file into the Stack
pop (Pop) - Pop a value from the registry file into the Stack
que (Queue) - Enqueue the current address into the stack
cal (Call) - Enqueue the current address into the stack, and jump to a specified address
ret (Return) - Pop and jump to the top value in the stack

Port Operations
pdr (Port Data Read) - Reads the port value to the registry file
pdw (Port Data Write) - Writes a value in the registry file to the port data
pdh (Port Data Header) - Reads the port data header to the registry file
pdi (Port Data Interrupt) - Sets the port Interrupt Address (If set to 0 will be void).

Port Device Specifications
Headers consist of a 2 ascii letter identifier (1 bits)

The data in and data out lines consist of 16 bits of data each

The port clock line is pulsed whenever a clock is sent

The port interrupt line when pulsed by the device will cause an interrupt in the system
